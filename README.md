An Arduino Weather Station. Measures temperature, raindrops, relative air humidity and ground humidity. Data is sent through GSM to Thinger.io
## Materials used
* Arduino UNO R3
* DHT 11, measuring air temperature and relative humidity
* FC-37, a rain drops detector
* LM393, mesuring ground humidity
* SIM800L V2.0, for GSM connection
## Power supply
For the GSM antenna, 2A current is needed. A smartphone 5V 10W adapter is used.
